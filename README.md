With a Bachelor’s Degree in computer science, numerous years of hands-on experience creating and implementing react and react native applications, and the ability to troubleshoot and solve problems in a timely and accurate manner, I confidently announce that I can work on any mobile application project. I truly believe in continued education and research and continue to seek new software and methods to assist with product development. I hope to bring my knowledge, and future knowledge, to your organization and new project.
